Hey there.

I'm a long time engineer from Tel Aviv, Israel and currently work at [Torq.io](https://torq.io/).
I started my journey as a Windows Internals engineer (C,C++) in the field of cyber security. However, for the past 8 years I've been working at multiple early stage SaaS startup companies as a Backend Engineer.

# 👨‍💻 Work
I currently work as an architect at __StackPulse__, an awesome startup company that is building an automated incident management system for SREs. Our technological stack is based on Go, GRPC, VueJS and like everyone else we are using the microservices architecture to build our product. I've joined StackPulse right at the very beginning as one of the first employees. I have the absolute preasure of working with some of the team at StackPulse for the 2nd or 3rd time.

You can find some of my blog posts over [here](https://grpcguide.com).
